For my 1:1 relationship my users table has unique constraints for email 
and phone number.

For a 1:Many relationship on my users table city, state and postal code which can be assigned to 
multiple users. 

For my Many:Many the users table connects to the cattle table through the user_id and the cattle
table connects to the products table where the cattle_id connects to the product_id.
